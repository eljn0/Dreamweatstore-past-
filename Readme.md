# Dreamwearstoreaze (my first business when i started 12 years old.)

Hi, I'm Eljan.

I'm going to write about my first and last business when i started 12 years old.
In 2018, I was in 7th grade. I need some money to buy laptop and etc. One day I realized i can start my own business on instagram and make my own money.

In Azerbaijan people are not using a lot of money to clothing but they are looking for quality.

I research about cheap delivering from Turkey.

And 2 days later I founded mover.az. After that i looked for clothing brands or boutiques for stocking clothes.

I founded (cinemashop, Cartoonshop and aksesuarix) boutiques from Instagram and contacted, asked for delivering, also maybe small discount for clothes.

I was lucky because they just said:
-It's okay.We are supporting instagram boutiques and we can make free delivery, discounts.But our partnership has to be at least 1 year.

I said ya it's my chance and i started posting post everyday in instagram.

I week later got my first order.(it was about 50$)

(My investor was my aunt btw, she helped me a lot special thanks to her)

1 year later I had to close my instagram boutique because of lessons and started learning coding.

But I had great experience,money and some friends from this business.

I belive i will continue this business in he future in Azerbaijan,Worldwide.

Nowadays, I'm about to finish my dropshipping account and i will start dropshipping in new year.
